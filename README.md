To run code you just need to open it in Visual Studio and run it.

Its currently configured to get all the news articles on startup so that we don't overload the news server.

The system only adds news article, it doens't clean out old ones.  

The system would likely be reset nightly which would clear out all news articles.

I've hard coded polling invervals to attempt to refresh the news every minute, but this can be changes as required.
